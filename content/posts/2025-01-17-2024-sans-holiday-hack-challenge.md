At the end of each year [SANS](https://www.sans.org/about/) hosts their Holiday Hack Challenge which they describe as "the most festive and challenging event of the year!". I decided to participate this year and I got this nifty badge to show for it.

# What is the Holiday Hack Challenge?

As part of their mission to provide high quality cyber security education and training, they put together the Holiday Hack Challenge as a fun and festive event for individuals to learn and compete in various domains.

This year the domains included:
- Ransomware Reverse Engineering
- Hardware Hacking
- Web App Hacking with MQTT and Video Feed Manipulation
- Video Game Hacking
- Threat Hunting with KQL
- SIM/SEM Analysis
- Mobile App Penetration Testing
- OSINT via Drone Path Analysis
- Web Exploration with cURL
- PowerShell for Cyber Defense

# What challenge did this badge come from?

I had a lot of fun working on all of the challenges this year, but I found the Threat Hunting with KQL to be uniquely enjoyable and unlike anything I'd done previously.
